# 📊 PageRank Algorithm — From Data to Analysis

This project implements the **PageRank algorithm** from real navigation data, following a rigorous approach inspired by Google’s original model.  
It covers the full pipeline: adjacency matrix construction, handling of dangling nodes, personalized PageRank, and an in-depth analysis of convergence and performance.

> 🏆 This project is accompanied by an **academic report graded 20/20**.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Implement the **PageRank** algorithm from raw data
- Build the transition matrix using a **stack-based path reconstruction**
- Study:
  - algorithm **convergence**
  - impact of the damping factor **β**
  - influence of the precision parameter **ε**
  - **computation time**
- Visualize PageRank concentration (Scan & Add / Lorenz curve)

## 🧠 Methodology

The project is structured into several key steps:

1. **Parsing & Mapping**
   - Extraction of unique pages
   - Page ↔ index mapping

2. **Adjacency Matrix Construction**
   - Path reconstruction using a **stack (pile) logic**
   - Directed link creation between pages

3. **Normalization**
   - Handling of _dangling nodes_
   - Row-stochastic normalization

4. **PageRank Computation**
   - Iterative formula: $q = \beta P q + \frac{1-\beta}{s} \sum q_i v$
   - ℓ₁ normalization
   - Convergence criterion based on ε

5. **Analysis & Visualization**
   - Cumulative distribution (Scan & Add)
   - Convergence vs β
   - Convergence vs ε
   - Computation time vs β
